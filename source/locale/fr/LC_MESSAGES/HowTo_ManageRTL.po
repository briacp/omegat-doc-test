"Using the RTL mode in OmegaT has no influence whatsoever on the display "
"mode of the translated documents created in OmegaT. The display mode of "
"the translated documents must be modified within the application (such as"
" Microsoft Word) commonly used to display or modify them (check the "
"relevant manuals for details). Using +Shift+ +Ctrl+ +O+ causes both text "
"input and display in OmegaT to change. It can be used separately for all "
"three panes (Editor, Fuzzy Matches and Glossary) by clicking on the pane "
"and toggling the display mode. It can also be used in all the input "
"fields found in OmegaT - in the search window, for segmentation rules "
"etc."

"When writing purely RTL text, the default (LTR) view may be used. In many"
" cases, however, it is necessary to embed LTR text in RTL text. For "
"example, in OmegaT tags, product names that must be left in the LTR "
"source language, place holders in localization files, and numbers in "
"text. In cases like these it becomes necessary to switch to RTL mode, so "
"that the RTL (in fact bidirectional) text is displayed correctly. It "
"should be noted that when OmegaT is in RTL mode, both source and target "
"are displayed in RTL mode. This means that if the source language is LTR "
"and the target language is RTL, or vice versa, it may be necessary to "
"toggle back and forth between RTL and LTR modes to view the source and "
"enter the target easily in their respective modes."

"As stated above, OmegaT tags are LTR strings. When translating between "
"RTL and LTR languages, correctly reading the tags from the source and "

"If the document allows, the translator is strongly encouraged to remove "
"style information from the original document so that as few tags as "
"possible appear in the OmegaT interface. Follow the indications given in "
"Hints for tags management. Frequently validate tags (see Tag validation) "
"and produce translated documents (see below and Menu) at regular "
"intervals to make it easier to catch any problems that arise. A hint: "
"translating a plain text version of the text and adding the necessary "
"style in the relevant application at a later stage may turn out to be "
"less hassle."
