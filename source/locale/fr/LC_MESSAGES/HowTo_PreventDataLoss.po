"OmegaT is a robust application. However, you should take precautions "
"against data loss when using OmegaT, just as with any other application. "
"When you translate your files, OmegaT stores all your progress in the "
"translation memory ``project_save.tmx`` that resides in the project's "
"``/omegat`` subfolder."

"OmegaT also backs up the translation memory to "
"project\\_save.tmx.YEARMMDDHHNN.bak in the same subfolder each time a "
"project is opened or reloaded. YEAR is the 4-digit year, MM is the month,"
" DD the day of the month, and HH and NN are the hours and minutes when "
"the previous translation memory was saved."
