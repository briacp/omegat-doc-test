Check Issues...
    Quality assurance tool that carries out all the automatic checks in
    one go and displays the results in a window.

    Four types of issues are detected:

    -  missing or displaced tags, including `custom
       tags <#dialogs.preferences.tagprocessing>`__. The Tag Issues
       option is always selected.

    -  Spelling Issues (optional). Only works if a spelling dictionary
       is installed.

    -  Terminology Issues (optional).

    -  LanguageTool Issues (optional).

    The results window is laid out in the form of a table in which:

    -  double-clicking a row activates the corresponding segment in the
       Editor pane,

    -  clicking a column header changes the sort order for the column,

    -  selecting or moving the mouse over a row displays a pop-up menu
       icon in the last column containing actions for correcting or
       ignoring the error.

Check Issues for Current Document
    As above, but only for the document currently displayed in the
    Editor pane.

Statistics
    Opens a new window and displays the project statistics, i.e. the
    project totals and totals for every file in the project.

Match Statistics
    Displays the Match Statistics for the project: the number of
    repetitions, exact matches, fuzzy matches and no-matches for
    segments, words and characters.

Match Statistics per File
    Displays the Match Statistics for each file of the project: the
    number of repetitions, exact matches, fuzzy matches and no-matches
    for segments, words and characters.

Align Files...
    Select the two files to be aligned (the source file and its
    translation) and click OK to open the `Align
    window <#windows.aligner>`__.

    The supported file formats are those listed in Project > Properties
    > File Filters.

    The source and target files can have different formats (for example,
    a ``.docx`` file can be aligned with a ``.pdf`` file).

Scripting...
    Opens the `Scripting window <#windows.scripts>`__, where the
    location of scripts can be set, and where scripts can be written,
    run and associated with a shortcut.

n - (script name)
    Launches scripts that have been associated with a number.

    To associate a script with a number:

    1. Open the Scripting window

    2. Select the script you want from the list on the left

    3. At the bottom of the window, right-click on a free number and
       select Add Script.

(external search commands)
    If commands to perform external searches have been defined in the
    `Preferences <#dialogs.preferences.externalsearch>`__, they are
    listed and accessible here.
